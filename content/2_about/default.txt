I'm a 'full-stack' designer, believe in great visual experiences in digital and analog context wherever the world takes me. Been designing & building things as an independent designer, for clients and startups, for the last (since: 2009) years. My work involves these themes:

The main passion in my work lies in the visual and graphic design; I deeply care about how aspects like layout, legibility, colours, typography and contrast work together to form a well designed environment, whether that’s in a virtual 3D environment, a voice operated interface, a web game on a 10” tablet or in print. The fluency with creative software as well as front-end programming languages (html, css, javascript) helps me to indeed realise this consistency of design.

I believe that working in digital design means an inherent link between visual/interaction design and the code that makes this happen — much like a (link: https://youtu.be/21DFmwZtVlQ target:_blank text: carpenter)'s knowledge & control of wood type and behaviour. Design ⇄ code.

Designing for the web and mobile apps can no longer be seen as an exercise on a fixed canvas where one lays out objects. Instead, it is an orchestration of dynamic elements, that can have different states & behaviours. (link: http://blog.froont.com/9-basic-principles-of-responsive-web-design/ target:_blank text:Responsive design) is a key tool in this orchestration — I've never designed a project without it.

In architecture, a parti describes the central organising idea of a building’s design; expressed in a basic diagram.
This represents the way I approach design: synthesising information into a clearly legible product that translates the message not only through its content, but even its initial appearance. I believe the values and considerations that are concerned with visual design are just as present in architecture: colour, proportions, materials, tactility, usability, and the continuous process of revision in search for true quality.

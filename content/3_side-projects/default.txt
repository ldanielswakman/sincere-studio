### Creative outlet
One of the best opportunities we have when working on digital projects, is that the road from imagination to realisation can be wonderfully short. This means that any good idea can be mocked up, prototyped and launched to a wider audience with minimum effort. My side projects focus on making this world a more transparent, liveable and equal place.

### Support?
The projects below are some of these projects that I initiated, co-initiated, or spent time on over the past years. If you want to support any of the projects, or support the developoment of new projects in the future, you can do so by buying me a coffee:

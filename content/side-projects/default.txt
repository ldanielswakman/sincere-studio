## Designers Circle
<span class="u-op50">2017-ongoing &nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; role: cofounder, organiser</span>
Together with other community members, I set up a weekly designers meetup, aimed at continuous exchange, advice and collaboration; there are multiple hundreds of designers in the channel. Aside from organising the weekly meetup, this involves projects like events, and a yearly zine publication. This initiative is part of (link: https://factoryberlin.com/ text:Factory Berlin target:blank), a community hub aimed at bringing together freelancers, startups and corporate businesses.

The Coworking Project is an initiative to give an easy overview of quality coworking spaces in the city. Started as a personal project, then expanded into a publicly available index for those that want to engage in flexible working. Built with VuePress & Netlify CMS.

### Creative outlet
One of the best opportunities we have when working on digital projects, is that the road from imagination to realisation can be wonderfully short. This means that any good idea can be mocked up, prototyped and launched to a wider audience with minimum effort. My side projects focus on making this world a more transparent, liveable and equal place.

### Support?
The projects below are some of these projects that I initiated, co-initiated, or spent time on over the past years. If you want to support any of the projects, or support the developoment of new projects in the future, you can do so by buying me a coffee:

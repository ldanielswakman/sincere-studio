Description: Experience & interface concept for inflight entertainment — in virtual reality

----

Intro: As a startup that has proven its worth as an innovator in the airline industry, I was invited to work with (link: https://inflight-vr.com/ text: Inflight VR target:blank) on one of their first concept interfaces that could be used in airline VR headsets.

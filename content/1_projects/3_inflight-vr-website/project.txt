Description: Telling an immersive story for a VR startup disrupting the transport industry

----

Intro: As a startup that has proven its worth as an innovator in the airline industry, they needed a website that tells the story as immersively as the inflight service they offer. We came up with a complete web experience built around a simple main story on the homepage, which trails off into details on secondary pages.

    For a freshly starting ambitious performance marketing agency, we were asked to develop a brand identity and a one-pager website — in a very short timespan.
    
    The brand workshop we organised was an essential tool to bring to the surface what kind of agency they wanted to be: New York, advertising, suit and tie + tongue in cheek — in other words, Mad Men (without the sexism). We came up with a minimal brand identity of sleek black with a golden touch and a strong and simple logo.

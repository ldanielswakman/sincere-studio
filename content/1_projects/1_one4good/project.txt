    ### Challenge
    In 2021, I got approached by one4good to help shape a new digital-first donation platform, which a very simple concept: a curated selection of social good projects for positive impact, where users can subscribe to for a fixed monthly amount. They needed help to shape the initial brand, then landing page, and ultimately the product design of the actual platform.

    ### Design System
    In order to set the foundations for a product language that could be iterated on and evolve, a flexible technology setup of a responsive web application was chosen (PWA).

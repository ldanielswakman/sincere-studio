    As a result of a multi-year PhD research on a personalised learning tool, the cover needed to reflect the look of the (link: http://www.mathsgarden.com/ text: Math Garden target:_blank) application (a garden in which children play mathematical games), but have a distinct identity that would stand on its own.

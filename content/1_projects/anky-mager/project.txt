    ### logo as stamp
    One of the earlier projects I did, where we were trying to come up with a clean identity for an independent trainer/couch. We came up with a simple pattern of two tiles, one inverted, slightly reminiscent of a classic character stamp. This motif and colour contrast became the leading principle for the visual identity, and was taken through to the website.

    ### clothes on a drying line
    
    Given the clearly segmented and compact text content, we adopted the visual principle of a clothing line: a horizontally panning thread where each text section would be pinned to. This provided both a clear visual organisation, as well as a intuitive interaction for visitors.

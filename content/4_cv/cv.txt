Interests:

  title: "Digital design as a responsive, context-sensitive solution that suits user's needs."
  employer: ""
  text: >
    The main passion in my work lies in the
    visual and graphic design; I deeply care
    about how aspects like layout,
    legibility, colours, typography and
    contrast work together to form a well
    designed environment, whether that’s
    in a virtual 3D environment, a voice
    operated interface, a web game on a
    10” tablet or in print. The fluency
    with creative software as well as
    front-end programming languages (html,
    css, javascript) helps me to indeed
    realise this consistency of design.

  title: Orchestration of dynamic elements
  employer: ""
  text: "Designing for the web and mobile apps can no longer be seen as an exercise on a fixed canvas where one lays out objects. Instead, it is an orchestration of dynamic elements, that can have different states & behaviours. Responsive design is a key tool in this orchestration — I've never designed a project without it."

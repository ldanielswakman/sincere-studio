Interests:

- 
  period: design
  img: [ ]
  title: "Digital design as a responsive, context-sensitive solution that suits user's needs."
  employer: ""
  text: >
    The main passion in my work lies in the
    visual and graphic design; I deeply care
    about how aspects like layout,
    legibility, colours, typography and
    contrast work together to form a well
    designed environment, whether that‚Äôs
    in a virtual 3D environment, a voice
    operated interface, a web game on a
    10‚Äù tablet or in print. The fluency
    with creative software as well as
    front-end programming languages (html,
    css, javascript) helps me to indeed
    realise this consistency of design.

  period: visual vs code

  title: 'Code is the grain and material of the web & app world'
  employer: ""
  text: "I believe that working in digital design means an inherent link between visual/interaction design and the code that makes this happen ‚Äî¬†much like a carpenter's knowledge & control of wood type and behaviour. Design < > code"
  url: ""
  projects: [ ]
- 
  period: responsive
  img: [ ]
  title: Orchestration of dynamic elements
  employer: ""
  text: "Designing for the web and mobile apps can no longer be seen as an exercise on a fixed canvas where one lays out objects. Instead, it is an orchestration of dynamic elements, that can have different states & behaviours. Responsive design is a key tool in this orchestration ‚Äî¬†I've never designed a project without it."
  url: ""

- 
  period: architectural vs graphic
  img: [ ]
  title: 'Shaping the world we experience & interact with'
  employer: ""
  text: 'I believe the values and considerations that are concerned with visual design are just as present in architecture: colour, proportions, materials, tactility, usability, and the continuous process of revision in search for true quality.'
